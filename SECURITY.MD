The safety and security of our project is our top priority. If you have discovered a security vulnerability within Libra-Office-Auto-Installer, we appreciate your cooperation in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Please follow these steps for reporting:

1. **Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
2. **Email**: Send an email to [officesecurity@lists.freedesktop.org](mailto:officesecurity@lists.freedesktop.org). Include the details of the vulnerability, steps for reproduction, and any other information that might be relevant.
3. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours.
4. **Communication**: We will communicate with you to understand more about the issue and ensure we have all the information needed to verify and then fix the vulnerability.
5. **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability has been resolved, we will discuss the timing and manner of any public disclosure with you.

We are committed to working with security researchers and the community to fix and disclose security vulnerabilities responsibly.
